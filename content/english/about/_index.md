Tired of being asked ALL THE TIME what cyber companies Shanna recommends for various pieces of cyber security work, she took to Slack to ask around so the idea was born to create a directory of Australian owned and run cyber security companies that was easy to search, find the services and products you want easily and these companies be vetted and validated. If you are up on your OSINT, you will see Shanna bought this domain `cyberanode` sometime ago and has finally found it a home.

# Why should we take part?
> On 22 November 2023, the Australian Government released the 2023-2030 Australian Cyber Security Strategy. The 2023-2030 Australian Cyber Security Action Plan supplements the Strategy, and details the key initiatives that will commence over the next two years to put us on a path to achieving our vision.

In order to strengthen our cyber resilience as a country the Australian Government has identified some key criteria and actions to take. CyberAnode aligns with the strategy in the following areas:

## 🛡️ Shield 5 - Sovereign capabilities
* Grow and expand Australia’s cyber skills pipeline
* Invest in domestic cyber industry growth
* Harness private sector innovation and expertise in the region

By shouting about our cyber strengths and making it easier for companies to find sovereign cyber companies, we're not just talking. We're making moves.
