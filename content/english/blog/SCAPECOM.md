## Who we are                     
SCAPECOM is a team of experienced, independent cybersecurity researchers based in Melbourne, Australia (the team behind ATTACKIFY). With a passion for building and breaking all things cyber, our team is dedicated to staying ahead of the curve and helping organisations stay safe and secure in an ever-changing digital landscape.

## What we do
For many organisations, the first time they truly understand their cyber security posture is when they experience an actual cyber attack. In reality many DEFENDERS may not be exposed to the various TACTICS, TECHNIQUES, or PROCEDURES that attackers use unless its during an actual ATTACK.

That's where ATTACKIFY comes in!

With ATTACKIFY, our mission is simple: to provide a valuable solution that help organisations improve their security posture without breaking the bank. We’ve put years of experience, trial and error, and countless ideas into creating a platform that empowers security professionals to improve their detection and prevention capabilities, and gain a better understanding of what attacks actually look like in their organisations.

Whether you're a small business owner or a large enterprise, we believe that everyone deserves access to high-quality cybersecurity solutions. That’s why we’ve designed ATTACKIFY to be accessible, affordable, and easy to use, without sacrificing on effectiveness or reliability.

So if you're looking for a powerful and reliable way to improve your cybersecurity posture, look no further than ATTACKIFY. With our team of experienced researchers and cutting-edge platform, you’ll have everything you need to stay ahead of the curve and keep your systems safe and secure.
